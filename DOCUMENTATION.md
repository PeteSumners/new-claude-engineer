## Introduction
Claude Engineer is an AI-powered assistant that combines natural language processing capabilities with a tool execution framework. It's designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use, providing a foundation for building more complex AI-driven applications.

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a flexible system where an AI service can interact with various tools to process user requests. In its current state, it demonstrates a basic implementation of this concept, with mock AI responses and a simple echo tool.

## Architecture
Claude Engineer follows a modular architecture with three main components:

1. AIService: Responsible for generating AI responses
2. ToolService: Manages and executes various tools
3. ClaudeEngineer: Integrates AIService and ToolService, handling user interactions

This design allows for easy expansion and modification of individual components without affecting the overall system.

## Components

### AIService
The AIService is responsible for generating responses to user inputs. 

Key features:
- Asynchronous `generate_response` method
- Currently uses a mock implementation that echoes the user's input
- Designed to be easily replaceable with more sophisticated AI models in the future

File: `ai_service.py`

```python
class AIService:
    async def generate_response(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        return f"You said: {user_input}. This is a mock response from the AI Service."
```

### ToolService
The ToolService manages and executes various tools. 

Key features:
- Maintains a dictionary of available tools
- `execute_tool` method to run specified tools
- Error handling for unknown tools
- Extendable design for adding more tools in the future

File: `tool_service.py`

```python
class ToolService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {
            "echo": self.echo_tool
        }

    def execute_tool(self, tool_name: str, *args, **kwargs):
        if tool_name in self.tools:
            return self.tools[tool_name](*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            return f"Error: Tool '{tool_name}' not found."

    def echo_tool(self, message: str):
        return f"Echo: {message}"
```

### ClaudeEngineer
The main class that integrates AIService and ToolService to process user requests.

Key features:
- Combines AI-generated responses with tool execution
- Provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction
- Easily extendable for more complex interactions

File: `main.py`

```python
class ClaudeEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ai_service = AIService()
        self.tool_service = ToolService()

    async def process_request(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        ai_response = await self.ai_service.generate_response(user_input)
        tool_response = self.tool_service.execute_tool("echo", ai_response)
        return f"AI Response: {ai_response}\nTool Response: {tool_response}"
```

## Installation
Currently, the project doesn't require any special installation steps. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

## Usage
To use Claude Engineer:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. Enter your queries when prompted
4. Type "exit" to end the session

## Testing
To run the tests:

1. Execute the AIService tests:
   ```
   python test_ai_service.py
   ```
2. Execute the ToolService tests:
   ```
   python test_tool_service.py
   ```

## Future Development
1. Implement a more sophisticated AI model for generating responses
2. Add more tools to the ToolService, such as:
   - Web search
   - Calculator
   - Weather information
   - File operations
3. Implement a plugin system for easy addition of new tools
4. Create a more advanced parsing system for user inputs to determine intent
5. Develop a web-based or GUI interface
6. Implement user authentication and personalization
7. Add logging and error tracking
8. Optimize performance for handling multiple requests
9. Implement conversation context management
10. Add configuration options for customizing AI and tool behaviors
