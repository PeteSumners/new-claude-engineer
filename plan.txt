If I were to create my own version of Claude Engineer with similar goals in mind, I would approach it with a focus on modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Here's how I would structure the project:

Architecture:
I would use a modular, microservices-like architecture, even if it's all running in a single process. This would make it easier to add, modify, or replace components as needed.
Core Components:

AI Service: Handles interactions with Claude and other AI models
Tool Service: Manages and executes various tools
File Service: Handles all file system operations
Execution Service: Manages code execution in isolated environments
User Interface Service: Handles all user interactions
Context Manager: Manages conversation history and file contents


Technology Stack:

Language: Python 3.9+
Dependency Management: Poetry for better dependency and virtual environment management
Async Framework: FastAPI for its excellent async support and automatic API documentation
UI: Textual for a rich, interactive TUI
Database: SQLite for lightweight storage of conversation history and file metadata
Testing: pytest for unit and integration tests
Type Checking: mypy for static type checking
Linting: flake8 and black for code style consistency


Key Features:

Plugin System: Allow easy addition of new tools and capabilities
Configurable AI Models: Ability to switch between different AI models or versions easily
Advanced Context Management: Intelligent handling of conversation history and file contents to maximize context utilization
Improved Code Execution: More robust isolation and resource management for executed code
Enhanced Automode: More sophisticated goal tracking and task decomposition
